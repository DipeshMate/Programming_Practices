'''What is Module in Python?
The module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file. 
It is an executable file and to organize all the modules we have the concept called Package in Python. 

Examples of modules:
Datetime
Regex
Random etc.

'''What is Package in Python?
The package is a simple directory having collections of modules. 
This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package. 
The package is simply a namespace. The package also contains sub-packages inside it.

Examples of Packages: 
Numpy 
Pandas

'''
What is Library in Python
The library is having a collection of related functionality of codes that allows you to perform many tasks without writing your code. 
It is a reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it into our program, we can just use it by importing that library and calling the method of that library with a period(.). 
However, it is often assumed that while a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of packages.

Examples of Libraries: 
Matplotlib
Pytorch
Pygame
Seaborn etc.
